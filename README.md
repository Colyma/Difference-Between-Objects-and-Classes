# Difference-Between-Objects-and-Classes

**Objects and Classes in Java Using Accounting as an Example**

In Java, the concepts of classes and objects are central to object-oriented programming (OOP). A **class** in Java can be thought of as a blueprint or template that defines the structure and behavior of objects. It specifies what attributes (properties) and methods (behaviors) the objects created from the class will have. In the context of accounting, a class might represent an entity like Account, defining attributes such as accountNumber, accountType, and balance, as well as methods like credit() and debit().

An object is a specific instance of a class. When you create an object, you instantiate the class, meaning you create a concrete example that occupies memory and has its own state. For instance, if you create an object myAccount from the Account class, it might represent a specific bank account with a particular account number, type (e.g., savings or checking), and balance. Each object can have different values for the attributes defined in the class, even though they share the same structure and behavior.

**Conceptual Differences:**

- Classes as Blueprints: A class in accounting terms could be seen as the design of an accountâ€”what it should track (like balance, account number) and how it should behave (like crediting or debiting money). This is a static concept; it exists as a definition until you create an object from it.
- Objects as Instances: An object is a specific account with its unique number, type, and balance. It is dynamic, existing in memory and capable of interacting with other objects or being manipulated by methods defined in its class.
